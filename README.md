The data sources utilized in this project are from Toronto's neighbourhood census data gathered from the years 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016. Toronto neighbourhood coordinates data is used for plotting Toronto neighbourhoods into a plotly express mapbox visualization.

The data utilized for this project was retrieved from the following websites:

* [Toronto Open Data](https://open.toronto.ca/)
